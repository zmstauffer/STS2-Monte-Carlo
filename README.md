# Qu'est-ce Spire? — AI Card Advisor for Slay the Spire 2

A real-time overlay mod that grades every card and relic offering, powered by community win-rate data. Think SpireLogs meets an in-game coach.

![Overlay Demo](docs/overlay-demo.png)

## What It Does

When you see a card reward, shop, or relic selection, the overlay instantly shows:

- **Tier grades** (S/A/B/C/D/F) for every option
- **Win-delta scores** — how much picking this card improves your chance of winning
- **Synergy analysis** — grades shift based on your current deck and archetype
- **"Best Pick" recommendation** with explanation

The advice gets smarter over time. Every run you play feeds back into the scoring system — your local data blends with community-wide stats from thousands of runs.

## How It Works

1. **Static tier data** — expert-curated base ratings for all 400+ cards and 150+ relics
2. **Deck analysis** — detects your archetype (poison, strength, frost, etc.) and adjusts grades for synergy
3. **Local learning** — tracks your picks and outcomes, computes personal win rates after each run
4. **Community stats** — anonymously uploads run data to a shared server, downloads aggregated pick/win rates from all players
5. **Adaptive blending** — as sample sizes grow, community data gradually overrides static tiers
